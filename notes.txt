To try nodemon, create a new npm runner script to run server.js using nodemon.
"scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon server.js"
},


Before using eslint, you need to configure it first. You do this by using the following command in the project Terminal.
npx eslint --init

Then you will be asked a number of questions, please answer the questions with the following answers:

How would you like to use ESLint? -> To check, find problems, and enforce code style.
What type of modules does your project use? -> CommonJS (require/exports).
Which framework did you use? -> None of these.
Does your project use TypeScript? -> N.
Where does your code run? -> Node (select using space).
How would you like to define a style for your project? -> Use a popular style guide.
Which style guide do you want to follow? -> (You are free to choose, for example choose AirBnB).
What format do you want your config file to be in? -> JSONs.
Would you like to …… (the whole next question) -> Y.

then we use ESLint to check the JavaScript code in the project. But before that, we need to add the following npm runner inside the package.json file:
"scripts": {
  "start": "nodemon server.js",
  "lint": "eslint ./"
},

this is how to generate access token & refresh token key
first, we have to type "node" in terminal
and then type require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex');
last, we copy the string token (do not copy the quote '')
